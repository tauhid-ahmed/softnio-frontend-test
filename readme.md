In this project, I built a clean and modular Vanilla JavaScript application using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern. This architecture ensures separation of concerns and maintainability, allowing for easier future updates and scalability. To enhance the styling, I utilized **SCSS**, implementing a structured and clean architecture that promotes reusability and future-friendly adjustments.

### Key Features:

- **MVC Architecture**: Organized code for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Clean SCSS Architecture**: Modular and reusable SCSS design for styling flexibility and easy updates.
- **No Dependencies**: Pure Vanilla JS with no external libraries, focusing on core JavaScript functionality.

## React App

This project demonstrates my use of **React** for building interactive and accessible web applications. I incorporated **Radix UI Slot** for enhanced accessibility and flexible component composition. Additionally, **Framer Motion** was used to add smooth animations for an improved user experience, while **TailwindCSS** was leveraged to streamline styling and ensure a responsive, mobile-first design.

### Key Features:

- **Radix UI Slot**: A powerful tool for creating accessible components and enhancing UX.
- **Framer Motion**: Provides smooth animations for better visual feedback and interactivity.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utilized for fast, responsive styling with utility-first classes.
- **Accessibility**: Focus on making the application accessible for all users.
